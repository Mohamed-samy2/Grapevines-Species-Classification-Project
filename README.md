# Grapevines Species Classification Project
 # A. Project Overview 
- Grapevines are significant agricultural plants, primarily cultivated 
for their fruits, which are consumed fresh or processed into 
various products such as wine, juice, and raisins. Additionally, 
grapevine leaves hold importance as they are harvested annually 
and used for culinary purposes, particularly in Mediterranean 
cuisine. The species of grapevine leaves play a crucial role in 
determining the quality, taste, and market value of the final 
products.

# B. Objective
- The objective of this project is hosted as a Kaggle competition,
to develop a deep learning-based classification system capable 
of accurately identifying grapevine leaf species from image data. 
By leveraging the power of deep learning algorithms, we aim to 
overcome the limitations of manual classification and provide a
reliable and efficient solution for grapevine leaf species 
classification. This project follows a systematic approach, 
encompassing the following steps:

    **1.** Data Collection: Obtain a dataset consisting of 
images of grapevine leaves belonging to different 
species.

  **2.** Preprocessing: Apply preprocessing techniques 
such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to 
prepare the data for training.

  **3.** Model Selection: Choose appropriate deep learning
CNN architectures for the classification task, 
considering factors such as model complexity and 
computational resources.

  **4.** Model Training: Train the selected models using the 
preprocessed dataset, optimizing model parameters 
to minimize the classification error.

  **5.** Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models on a 
separate test dataset to assess their performance in 
accurately classifying grapevine leaf species.

  **6.** Performance Analysis: Analyze the performance of 
the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score.

    **7.** Fine-tuning and Optimization: Fine-tune the models 
and explore optimization techniques to further 
improve classification performance.

    **8.** Deployment: Deploy the trained classification system 
for practical use, potentially integrating it into 
agricultural processes for automated species 
identification.

# Methodology
- In our exploration of deep learning architectures for 
grapevine leaf species classification, we initially 
experimented with building custom Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN) architectures from scratch. However, 
these attempts yielded unsatisfactory results, with the 
models struggling to predict and classify the images 
correctly, resulting in low accuracy. Recognizing the 
limitations of our custom architectures, we transitioned to 
leveraging pretrained CNN architectures, which have been 
trained on large-scale image datasets and have 
demonstrated strong performance in various image 
classification tasks. We explored several state-of-the-art 
pretrained architectures, including **Inception**, **EfficientNet**, 
**MobileNet**, **Xception**, **Inception-ResNet** and **ViT (Vision Transformer)**, 
adapting them to suit the requirements of our grapevine 
leaf species classification task.
